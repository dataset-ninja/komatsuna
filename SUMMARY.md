**KOMATSUNA Dataset for Instance Segmentation, Tracking and Reconstruction** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and monocular depth estimation tasks. It is used in the biological research. 

The dataset consists of 1560 images with 0 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*leaf*). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *multi-view* (1080 images) and *rgb-d* (480 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 6 image splits: ***multi_original*** (0 objects), ***multi_plant*** (0 objects), ***rgbd_depth*** (0 objects), ***rgbd_depth_ours*** (0 objects), ***rgbd_original*** (0 objects), and ***rgbd_plant*** (0 objects). Additionally, images are grouped by ***im_id***, and every *leaf* has ***old*** tag. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2017 by the Kyushu University, Japan.
